        <h1>STANDCON 2025: Big Bang Theory - Fri, Mar 7, 2025</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="lead"></p>
    <h4 id="challenge-description">Challenge Description</h4>
<p>Big Bang Theory was the final challenge in a set of three challenges (the first two being the hardware challenge by Justin and the snake game challenge by <a href="https://mcdulltii.github.io/">Aaron (@mcdulltii)</a> respectively) used in Cyber League Finals (run during STANDCON 2025). The theme was &ldquo;Defuse The Device&rdquo;, where two teams of three had two hours to complete as many of the three challenges as possible before we all üí• explode üí•</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the challenge description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To uncover the secrets of the <del>bomb</del> device (and prevent everyone from going out in a fiery mess!), you will need to read secrets from the kernel with the help of your trusty debugger and qemu.</p></blockquote>
<p>Challenge files can be obtained here: <a href="https://github.com/KaligulaArmblessed/CTF-Challenges/tree/main/Big_Bang_Theory">https://github.com/KaligulaArmblessed/CTF-Challenges/tree/main/Big_Bang_Theory</a></p>
<p>Note that the files distributed to the participants (dist) and the files hosted on the server (service) are different &ndash; this is because the goal of the challenge is just to leak the secret message (obtaining root is not required). The secret message is actually a simple Chemistry riddle, which when solved will tell the participants which wire to cut to defuse the, ahem, <strong>device</strong>. ‚ùåüí£ ‚úÖüñ•Ô∏è</p>
<h4 id="fun-facts-and-spoilers">Fun Facts and Spoilers</h4>
<p>Fun fact 1: I was made to hide underneath a table for ‚ú® dramatic effect ‚ú®, and pop out only when the kernel challenge was revealed. I was underneath the table in the middle:</p>
<p><img src="/images/standcon2025-bigbangtheory/notunderatable.jpg" alt="View from Not Underneath A Table"></p>
<p>If you have ever wondered what the view from underneath a table is like, here you go:</p>
<p><img src="/images/standcon2025-bigbangtheory/undertableview.jpg" alt="View from Underneath A Table"></p>
<p>Fun fact 2: I was kicked once when I was underneath the table üò≠</p>
<p>If you were able to leak the secret message, this is what you would have got:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>5TANDing here I realize
The elements
can be my guide 
My atomic weight
Is twice my number
Bonded with 6 hydrogens
We form a hexagon
My number is
the secret key
To stopping this bomb
From combusting you see
</code></pre><p>This is a Chemistry riddle. There are a few elements with an atomic weight that is twice their atomic number &ndash; carbon, nitrogen and oxygen to name a few. The riddle then states that when bonded with 6 hydrogens, they will form a hexagon &ndash; this is a reference to benzene (C<del>6</del>H<del>6</del>), which comprises of 6 carbons and 6 hydrogens. Here is the aromatic representation of benzene: ‚è£, and here is the Kekule representation ‚å¨ (this is totally not an excuse for me to put cute Chemistry symbols onto my blog). The riddle finally states that the &ldquo;number&rdquo; (referring to the atomic number) is the secret key to stopping the bomb from combusting, meaning that the participants have to cut the <strong>6th</strong> wire (since carbon&rsquo;s atomic number is 6)!</p>
<p>There are also other references in this riddle &ndash; &ldquo;5TANDing here&rdquo; is a reference to both &ldquo;5TANDCON&rdquo; (since this is the fifth iteration of STANDCON) and the song &ldquo;It Has To Be This Way&rdquo; from Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance (which is the awesomest stupid thing to exist and the stupidest awesome thing to exist according to a YouTuber, and I agree with this judgement wholeheartedly). If you haven&rsquo;t noticed from other posts on this blog, MGR is one of my favourite games, and many of my CTF challenges have silly MGR references in them (one of them being <a href="https://kaligulaarmblessed.github.io/post/dead-pwners-society/">Dead Pwners&rsquo; Society&rsquo;s supposedly &ldquo;F**king Invincible Kernel&rdquo;</a> with all its protections). Also, during Cyber League Finals, two songs were played: the instrumental of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYAPgPH9hsI">MGR&rsquo;s It Has To Be This Way</a> (this links to the vocal version though, because it is simply an iconic meme) when the kernel challenge was revealed, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5bGnPOfgKQ">Hacknet OS&rsquo;s Panic Track</a> by The Algorithm (an awesome band) for the last two minutes or so of the CTF.</p>
<p>Challenge design wise, I&rsquo;ve always wanted to turn the silly <code>anon_vma_name</code> technique into a CTF challenge because I thought it would be funny so here it is!</p>
<p>Now, for the solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploit double fetch by quickly flipping a variable</li>
<li>Turn double fetch into heap overflow, then do a one byte overwrite to corrupt a pointer so you have two pointers pointing at the same object</li>
<li>Trigger free to get UAF</li>
<li>Spray anon_vma_name over the victim object</li>
<li>Trigger the ticker write function to write the secret to the anon_vma_name object</li>
<li>Leak the riddle about which wire to cut by reading /proc/pid/maps</li>
</ol>
<p>The full exploit can be obtained here: <a href="https://github.com/KaligulaArmblessed/CTF-Challenges/blob/main/Big_Bang_Theory/solution/exploit.c">https://github.com/KaligulaArmblessed/CTF-Challenges/blob/main/Big_Bang_Theory/solution/exploit.c</a></p>
<p>One of my other favourite things that happened in Cyber League Finals was the hand-drawn hardware diagram by Justin given to the participants:</p>
<img src="/images/standcon2025-bigbangtheory/hardware_drawing.jpg" alt="Hardware drawing" width="600" style="margin-bottom: 20px;"/>
<p>The other thing that happened in STANDCON that I found incredibly funny was this:</p>

<p>Yes, this is totally not a silly reference&hellip;</p>
