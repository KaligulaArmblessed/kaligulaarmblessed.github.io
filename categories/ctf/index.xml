      <description>TLDR CVE-2023-31248 is an n-day bug affecting nftables reported by Mingi Cho. The bug report and patch can be found here: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=515ad530795c118f012539ed76d02bacfd426d89. Linux kernel versions before 6.2.0-26 generic are vulnerable to this bug. My exploit has been tested on Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster), with kernel version 6.2.0-20 generic.

      <title>nftables Adventures: An Introduction to Bug Hunting and the Dormant State Bug [Part 1]</title>
      <link>https://kaligulaarmblessed.github.io/post/nftables-adventures-1/</link>

      <description>TLDR I tried my hand at bug hunting within the nftables subsystem in the Linux kernel, and managed to find a bug where if the dormant state of a table was toggled in a certain way, the kernel would attempt to deactivate hooks that were never activated in the first place. The bug report can be found here: https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c?id=c9bd26513b3a11b3adb3c2ed8a31a01a87173ff1. Unfortunately (or fortunately), the bug cannot be transformed into a UAF as the kernel performs certain checks that prevents us from reaching any interesting frees.</description>

      <title>prctl anon_vma_name: An Amusing Linux Kernel Heap Spray</title>
      <link>https://kaligulaarmblessed.github.io/post/prctlheapspray/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 22 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://kaligulaarmblessed.github.io/post/prctlheapspray/</guid>
      <description>TLDR prctl PR_SET_VMA (PR_SET_VMA_ANON_NAME) can be used as a (possibly new!) heap spray method targeting the kmalloc-8 to kmalloc-96 caches. The sprayed object, anon_vma_name, is dynamically sized, and can range from larger than 4 bytes to a maximum of 84 bytes. The object can be easily allocated and freed via the prctl syscall, and leaked information can be obtained via reading the proc/pid/maps file. The advantage of this method is that it does not require a cross-cache attack from cg/other caches (unlike other objects such as msg_msg) as anon_vma_name is allocated with the GFP_KERNEL flag.</description>
